# ELVO-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
The point of this project is to predict if a patient had a stroke using 3D images of the brain. Our goal was to speed up the detection process to increase the chances of patientâ€™s survival.

This project was worked on by Victoria Gras Andreu and Ashley Weber.

We included our resulting code in the final_code file.  This include the code for the preproccessing and our model.  
The results of our model and project as whole can be found in the report file.
